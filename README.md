## Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

•	Assumption 1 (ex: missing country records were for customers based in the US, and were re-coded to be US citizens)

•	Assumption 1 (ex: data for December 2021 was missing - this was imputed using a combination of historical trends and December 2020 data)

•	Assumption 1 (ex: because 3% of the refund date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis)
