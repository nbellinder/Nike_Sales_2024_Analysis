-- EXAMINE OUR DATA SET
SELECT *
FROM nike_sales_2024;

-- OUR DATA SET HAS 3 MAIN CATEGORIES, THEY ARE VERY BROAD AND MAY NOT PROVE USEFUL
SELECT *
FROM nike_sales_2024
GROUP BY Main_Category;

-- SUBCATEGORY MAY SERVE USEFUL IN FILTERING THE DATA BEFORE WE GET TO INDIVIDUAL PRODUCT LINES AS WE HAVE 11 SUB CATEGORIES EACH WITH THEIR OWN PRODUCT LINES
SELECT *
FROM nike_sales_2024
GROUP BY Sub_Category

-- NARROW OUR SCOPE TO SEE THAT PRODUCT LINES ARE ONLY DIFFERENTIATED BY PRICE, ALSO NOT EVERY PRODUCT WAS SOLD IN EVERY REGION EVERY MONTH
